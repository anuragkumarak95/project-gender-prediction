# project-gender-prediction
a simple project on machine learning concepts
# Our Aim:

our air is to build a predictive code that could predict the gender of a new user thought some of example DATA set provided to the code.

#K - Mapping Cluster:

K map cluster is a algorithm used to introduce machine learning to a code. firstly we provide some example data to the code to analyse, this data is most probably considered in the format of a 2D graph ,i,e, to attributes of a data interlinked to each other in such a way that they can conclude the category of the element in that point in the graph.

it creates clusters of data ranges which are closely positioned to each other and a point is given to the major element predictor (k) which is calculated to be the mean position of all the elements present in the cluster.

Lets implement this algorithm of machine learning to produce a code that could predict the gender of a user throught the provided data about the user ,i,e, their height and weight.

#how to choose the attributes of the graph:
one should choose those properties as attributes that can very distinctly be seperated and well define the users identity for the given prediction to make. thats why, we took the relation between height and weight in between the male and female clusters as it can very well define 2 diffrent clusters in the graph to predict the new unique users gender.
